# WinCMDMenuDN

Menu system for Windows Command Prompt batch scripts with (eventually) dynamic numbering.

This example copies a selected folder from a network share to a local folder. I use this to stage install files locally before performing the install.  
The effective command is echoed instead of actually being run.
